Wavefront OBJ/MTL Highlighting in Atom
======================================

This package adds syntax highlighting for [Wavefront OBJ files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) (`.obj`),
as well as its complementary format for describing surface materials (`.mtl`).

Specifications for both formats are included for casual reference in the `specs/` folder:

* [OBJ](https://github.com/Alhadis/language-wavefront/blob/master/specs/obj.pdf)
* [MTL](https://github.com/Alhadis/language-wavefront/blob/master/specs/mtl.rst)
