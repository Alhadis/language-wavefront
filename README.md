Wavefront OBJ/MTL Highlighting in Atom
======================================

This package adds syntax highlighting for [Wavefront OBJ files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) (`.obj`),
as well as its complementary format for describing surface materials (`.mtl`).

Format reference
----------------
The original Wavefront OBJ specification survives in the form of a PDF file
circulated between various third-party sources. To help preserve a moribund
file-format, I've included copies of original specifications with this repo:

* [`docs/obj-spec.pdf`](docs/obj-spec.pdf)
* [`docs/mtl-spec.rst`](docs/mtl-spec.rst)

The [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000507.shtml)
also has an excellent article detailing the format's syntax and background,
although some of its inline citations have succumbed to link rot.
